This program runs statistical analysis on a reduced-size (32 bits rather than 256 bits) version of TentHash's mixer.  This smaller mixer is structurally identical to the full-size mixer and has rotation constants tuned to have similar diffusion characteristics.

This lets us conduct statistical tests that are infeasible with the full-size mixer, such as collision tests using an appreciable fraction of the total bits being mixed.  Keep in mind that this is **not proof** that the full-size version has all the same properties, but it is nevertheless good evidence that the general construction is good.
