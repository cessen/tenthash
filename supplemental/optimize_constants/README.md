This is the program used to generate TentHash's rotation constants.

I've tried to clean up the code somewhat, add comments to help explain intent,
etc.  But do note that this is more-or-less "throw away" code, since only one
set of constants was needed.  It is provided so that people can check the work
behind TentHash if desired.
